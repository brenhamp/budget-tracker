## Description

This budget tracker uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) to record transactions. Users can add or subtract amounts from their total, and can even make transactions while offline that will be stored in the cache and uploaded when they come back online.

## Installation

Use 'npm i' or 'npm install' to install the required packages. Then use the command 'npm start' to run the server. Navigate to your localhost port and you should see the page.

## Usage

Enter your transaction amount and a name for your transaction (e.x. "lunch"). Then hit the add (or subtract) funds button. Your total at the top will be updated, the transaction will be recorded in a list, and you will see a graph that tracks your total over time.

## Challenges

The hardest parts of this assignment were getting a user's thoughts to be deleted when that user is deleted, and getting the friend and reaction counts to work appropriately. I still think there's room for improvement. For example, there's a few useless data fields that could probably be removed without consequence, and the pathing for the routes is a little convoluted with some redundancies, such as needing to specify the ID in both the path and the JSON body. Overall, I am happy with it, but it could definitely use some work to make it really streamlined.
